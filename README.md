# HungryBall
I bet you can't do more than 1000 points! Hungry Ball wants to eat most of the foods on his own way. Be careful, some foods are just a bait to distract your attention. Every block you pass is 1 point and every food you  eat is 3 point. You will notice but I wanted to warn you that the ball is gonna speed up. Be fast with your fingers.<br><br>
Hungry Ball is a 3D game which made with Unity. Animations, sound effects, customized sprites, 3D arts and creativity is used. <br><br>
Good luck, have fun! <br><br>
